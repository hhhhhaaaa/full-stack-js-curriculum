# Phase 1 Development


<!-- - meet with each learner once a week for 20m to assess progress
  - this shakes out to about 2 hours a day to meet 1-1
- clarity on modules
- Di and Ethan are coaches for phase 1 and 2
- learners place a `i need help` indicator on their monitor


### Remote

- Answer questions in the phase help channels
- Phase 2) code reviews
- Remote desktop screen share for skill evaluations
- Office Hours
- Recorded lectures
 -->

## Ideas For Other Modules

- Create a lot of command line tools (CLIs) and programs
- Read several CSV files and do manual joins to extract data
- Build underscore.js
- Create a schema for modeling a simple app (caf√©, basketball statistics)


## Questions

- How will learners track and report the modules they're working on, the
modules they've completed, and the skills they believe they now have?
- How will instructors review learner work?
- How will instructors give qualitative feedback on learners work?
- When / How to SEPs lecture or AMA?
- How do scheduled 1-1s work?
- how do learners capture their work for review/sharing with their SEP when
using external resources?
- what does daily learning look like at this phase?
- how long are assignments?
- do we use any of our existing projects at this phase?
- should learners interact with subject areas on a pre-determined schedule
(i.e.: syllabus style? ) or should we enable more flexibility to move around
subject areas within a phase (i.e.: not every learner in the phase is studying
the same thing at the same time)?
- how does the answer to the above impact lectures - both content and
scheduling?
