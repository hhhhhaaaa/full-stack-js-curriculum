# Phase 5 Development

## Technical Interview Prep

### Mock Interviews

There are several different types of mock interviews we should do:

- non-technical: culture / team-fit
- technical
  - systems design
  - algorithms
  - data structures

#### Technical Interviews

##### Systems Design

- [ ] "Webstagram" (web-based Instagram clone)
- [ ] build a URL-shortener (a la bit.ly)

##### Algorithms

- [ ] given a directed graph (digraph), detect if there are cycles (depth-first search)
- [ ] build a web crawler (breadth-first search)
- [ ] find all words on a Boggle(tm) board

##### Data Structures

- [ ] add 1 to a number represented as a linked list
  - (e.g., input: 1->9->9->9; output: 2->0->0->0)
- [ ] find largest number in binary-search-tree which is <= N
- [ ] find all pairs [x, y] in Array of integers where sum(x, y) === N

### Workshops / Lectures

- [ ] problem decomposition / whiteboard-interview strategy
- [ ] systems design interviews

## Miscellaneous

### Workshops / Lectures

- [x] compensation, offers, and negotiation
